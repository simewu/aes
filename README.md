# AES Calculator
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) has been adopted worldwide, and is based on the design principle known as the substitutionâ€“permutation network. Unlike its predecessor DES, AES does not use a Feistel network. AES has a fixed block size of 128 bits, and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
